        We are proud to partner with many local growers directly so that
        customers are provided with the freshest, seasonal produce available
        in Western Australia. To compliment this, we are at the Perth Markets
        early in the morning to ensure that we stock the greatest range of
        produce available all year round.

  meat: {
    title: 'Meat',
    copy: <p>We sell carefully sourced free range, organic and biodynamic meat from West Australian farms. We promote organic and biodynamic meat which values humane treatment of animals. This allows them to feed naturally on land free of pesticides, rather than being force fed grain, and as a result the meat is healthier and richer in flavour.</p>,
